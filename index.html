    <h2>Ísland: Day 1</h2>
    <p>Oh, I wish I could sleep on planes. We took a red eye flight to Reykjavík, and I didn't sleep a lick. By the time we picked up our rental car, it was 9&nbsp;am local. And I was exhausted. And cranky.</p>
    <p>Our first stop was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljalandsfoss">Seljalandsfoss</a>-- a two hour drive. I was planning on just sleeping in the car for a while (as I was the first to drive... wtf?!), but then we arrived.</p>

    <p>Unreal. We hiked around the base of the waterfall, and climbed up the hill to get a overlook of the whole valley. I've never seen so many different landscape elements... it was magical.  </p>
    <p>We eventually hopped back in the car and headed down a few kilometres down the road to a natural spring and pool that we had heard about. At this point, we didn't have cell phone service, and no GPS... so were not real certain we'd find the place. We parked and hiked a couple miles in, and found the pool.</p>

    <p>We had worked up a sweat on the hike in, and it had warmed up a bit, so we stripped down and hopped in pool. It was <strong>PERFECT</strong>. The hot spring fed into this man made pool, and kept it just warm enough. We again got another great view of this valley and the range behind it. I could have stayed there for hours.</p>
    <p>We eventually packed up and drove about an hour to our cabin in <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189978-d2402443-r153898149-Black_Sand_Beach-Vik_South_Region.html">Reynisfjara</a>. The cabin overlooked the ocean, and we retreated well before sunset. A+ first day.</p>
